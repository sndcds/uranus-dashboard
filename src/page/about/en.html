    <h1>Uranus – a platform for a connected cultural landscape</h1>

    <p>
        Uranus is an <strong>open, collaboratively developed platform for event data</strong>.
        It understands culture not as a product, but as a <strong>living, diverse and socially relevant space</strong>.
        Its goal is to make cultural activities visible, connected and sustainably accessible –
        regardless of size, budget or reach.
    </p>

    <p>
        Especially in a cultural landscape engaging with <strong>digital transformation, sustainability and participation</strong>,
        there is a need for tools that are not only efficient, but also value-driven.
        Uranus was created to fill this gap:
        as a <strong>digital infrastructure</strong> that enables collaboration,
        shares knowledge and strengthens cultural diversity.
    </p>

    <h2>Making culture visible – beyond market-driven logic</h2>

    <p>
        Many small, volunteer-run or non-commercial cultural offerings remain digitally invisible,
        even though they form the backbone of local cultural scenes.
        Uranus deliberately addresses this issue:
        <strong>all events are treated equally</strong> – regardless of budget, visibility or economic interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through structured, open data, even small initiatives can present their activities
        on equal footing and distribute them across different channels –
        without additional costs and without dependency on commercial platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>Shaping digital transformation together</h2>

    <p>
        Uranus is <strong>open source</strong> and invites active participation.
        Municipalities, cultural institutions, independent initiatives and developers
        can jointly develop the platform and adapt it to their specific needs.
        Digitalisation is not consumed here – it is actively shaped.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Open interfaces for websites, apps, city portals or public displays</li>
        <li>Reusable data instead of parallel, isolated solutions</li>
        <li>Transparent structures instead of proprietary dependencies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sustainable, accessible and participation-oriented</h2>

    <p>
        Sustainability also means using resources responsibly –
        both technically and organisationally.
        Uranus reduces duplicated data maintenance, facilitates cooperation
        and helps build long-term digital structures.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the same time, the platform places strong emphasis on <strong>accessibility and inclusion</strong>:
        information about accessibility, target groups or conditions
        helps people find suitable cultural offerings and participate in them.
    </p>

    <h2>For a diverse and connected cultural future</h2>

    <p>
        Uranus does not see itself as a finished product,
        but as a <strong>shared project</strong>.
        An invitation to everyone who envisions culture as open, solidaristic and future-oriented –
        and who wants to use digital tools to expand cultural participation,
        rather than limit it.

    <h1>Who Uranus is for</h1>

    <p>
        Uranus is aimed at people and organisations
        who understand culture as a <strong>public, collective and shapeable space</strong>.
        The platform brings together very different actors
        without reducing them to roles such as “providers” and “consumers”.
    </p>

    <h3>Cultural initiatives & independent scenes</h3>
    <p>
        For independent groups, initiatives, collectives, associations and individual practitioners,
        Uranus offers a way to make events visible
        without having to submit to commercial platform logics.
        Small, experimental or volunteer-driven activities
        gain a digital presence that creates reach
        without adding administrative burden.
    </p>

    <h3>Cultural institutions & venues</h3>
    <p>
        Museums, theatres, socio-cultural centres, libraries, clubs
        and other cultural venues can use Uranus
        to publish their events in a structured and sustainable way.
        Instead of maintaining data multiple times,
        content can be managed centrally and reused in different contexts –
        from an organisation’s own website to municipal or regional portals.
    </p>

    <h3>Municipalities, networks & cultural administration</h3>
    <p>
        For cities, communities and cultural policy actors,
        Uranus provides a transparent foundation
        to make cultural activity visible,
        analyse it and develop it strategically.
        The platform supports cultural policies
        focused on <strong>participation, diversity and long-term structures</strong>,
        rather than short-term individual projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Audiences & culturally interested people</h3>
    <p>
        People who want to experience culture
        find a low-threshold entry point
        into a diverse cultural landscape through Uranus.
        Filters by interests, location, time or accessibility
        make orientation easier and foster participation –
        including beyond well-established and heavily promoted offerings.
    </p>

    <h3>Developers & digital practitioners</h3>
    <p>
        As an open-source project, Uranus also addresses people
        who want to help shape digital tools for culture.
        Open interfaces, transparent data models
        and a collaborative development approach
        invite the creation of new applications, visualisations
        and innovative use cases.
    </p>

    <h3>A platform for collaboration</h3>
    <p>
        At its core, Uranus is for everyone
        who does not think of culture in isolation,
        but as a <strong>connected, solidaristic and learning system</strong>.
        The platform aims to build bridges –
        between institutions and independent scenes,
        between analogue practice and digital infrastructure,
        and between local initiatives and broader visibility.
