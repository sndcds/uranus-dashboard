    <h4>Liability for content</h4>
    <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general legislation
        pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).
        However, according to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
        third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general legislation remain unaffected by this.
        However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific infringement.
        If we become aware of any such legal infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

        The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
        The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
        Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
        However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement.
        If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
