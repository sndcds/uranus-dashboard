    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        This guide explains how to create your own <strong>organization</strong> with a
        <strong>venue</strong>, optional <strong>rooms</strong>, and an <strong>event</strong>.
        This structure forms the foundation for nearly all features in Uranus.
        Therefore, it is important to provide complete and high-quality information for each area.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Most information you enter in Uranus is publicly visible.
        You will be explicitly informed when data is used internally only.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Uranus can also be used <strong>without creating your own organization</strong>.
        In this case, you will be invited as a team member by an existing organization.
